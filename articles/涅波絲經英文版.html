<h2 id="prologue" class="chapter-title">Prologue: The Revelation of the Greatest Sin</h2>
<p>One afternoon, he stood where the waves kissed the sand like a spirit in pain, where the sea-wind and the sorrow were half in cast wails but he came not for joy, only for oblivion—fled from dreams those shadows of yesteryear!</p>
<p>And lo! And then, as he turned to take the long, lonely way home, there met his gaze a most curious sign:</p>
<p>"Hast thou eaten thy burger yet today?"</p>
<p>He lifted his eyes and read the words, but he stared a long, long while, as if he were interpreting a language not of his world. The letters curled like a prophet’s script, complete and round, and were hewn by hand across a radiant expanse of deep cerulean — a shade not of this world, but called into existence to wrench him from his despair.</p>
<p>Lost in contemplation and numbed by the crush, onward he pushed—</p>
<p>And there, under that sign, was a door:</p>
<p>An old, ancient, ajar wooden gate with a bronze sign above it that reads this name:</p>
<p>The Church of Nebo.</p>
<p>An invisible power now laid hold on his limbs and impelled him inward. Its wood creaking and caked dust exhaling from between its crevices, the door yawned open — and he entered.</p>
<p><i>What world was this?</i></p>
<p>A cathedral impossible to draw by hand or dream — walls of glass, a kaleidoscope divine; a ceiling vast, as constellations bound in time. And at its center: a towered and reeling presence, a statue tall and shuddering, hands clasped in reverent pose, brow aglow from holy light.</p>
<p><i>The face was mercy, the pose judgment.</i></p>
<p>It was <b>She. Neboskey.</b></p>
<p>He stood as struck. <i>Yea, struck to the marrow.</i> Some strange sacredness had taken hold of him and squeezed from the depths a shiver — a sensation he had not known for years.</p>
<p>And he whispered — nothing but his soul heard it:</p>
<p><i>What is this tingling... this gentle loosening of my Worst Sin?</i></p>
<p>And finally a voice — a man’s, lined by linen and awe:</p>
<p>“She sends for thee as well. Come, stranger. Shed your Most Sin, and come along with us, the faithful of Nebo.”</p>
<p>“Then... so be it,” he said, as if the words had been years in waiting.</p>
<p><i>“Let me be enrolled with you.”</i></p>
<p>So it was, the rite began.</p>
<p>The Priestess loomed over him in a room as dark as the beginning of time, under the hidden stars of the dome.</p>
<p><i>And then the foot — her sacred sole over his chest.</i></p>
<p><i>And then the deluge — holy water, a flood from on high, stifling but holy.</i></p>
<p><i>For in the death of the flesh, the soul was able to breathe again.</i></p>
<p>So were they born, the rite was accomplished – <i>by submission, by silence, by smothering</i> – the Most Sin was purged.</p>
<p>And afterward, he took to himself a new name in faith:</p>
<p><b>Geesman</b>.</p>
<p>So begins the tale.</p>
<p><i>The story of rise, of challenges, of truths uninvited.</i></p>

<section>
<h2 id="chapter1" class="chapter-title">Chapter One: <b>The Genesis of Geesman's Faith</b></h2>
<p><i>On a silent, stifling morning, the hallowed hall filled with the rarest scent — no, not incense but burgers, warm and delicious.</i></p>
<p>And lo! <b>She drew nigh, majestic, not as mortals step, but as a nightmare sheathed in secretest mantle.</b></p>
<p>The color of her hair was <i>ash and argent twisted together</i>, her garb a <i>black-and-white dance of pattern</i>, her stockings and the color of the skies on a day kissed by some unheard grace.</p>
<p>Instantly, a pang of memory struck him in the gut. <i>Where had he seen her face?</i> Ah! The statue, rehearsed in stone—<b>can it be?</b> Was this the <b>High Priestess</b>, buried in a legend, whom men name the <b>Highest Hierophant</b>?</p>
<p>Then she spoke, as softly she replied:</p>
<p><b>"Hail, my faithful. Welcome to the Church of Nebo. I am thy Hierophant... <i>Neboskey</i>."</b></p>
<p>And hearing thus, he fell. <i>His knees buckled, not of his volition, but wrenched by the force of awe; worship sprang up not as something he did but as something done to this man from inside.</i></p>
<p>She spake no more. There was only silence, and from that silence a <b>smile emerged — soft, unfathomable, divine.</b></p>

<h2 id="chapter2" class="chapter-title">Chapter Two: <b>The Morning of Geesman</b></h2>
<p>As the world traded in the day for the night, there in the twilight of dawn, the bell of Nebo Church awakened the whole of its heavenly followers.</p>
<p>And he, even as they, prayed not from lip, but from heart, and said within himself:</p>
<p><b>"Nebo, Nebo… O mighty Hierarch of the Highest Flame, I thank thee for thine embrace. Lo, I stand here before thee, nekked and bare of my sin; I cast out and am all white and beyond thee and above thee."</b></p>
<p>Hand in hand they strolled, <i>not to an altar or to a holy writ</i>, for the matter-whereunto was a hall— but not a hall, instead a sanctum, <i>a temple made to look as a fast-food den</i>.</p>
<p>This, they knew, was no ordinary restaurant, but <i>the Common Table of the Devout</i>.</p>
<p>Now, each soul is to wash their flesh in the consecrated water, <i>singing this song as they wash</i>:</p>
<p><b>"With holy water I will bathe and It shall cleanse my soul."</b></p>
<p>So cleansed they returned to their places and sat waiting for their heavenly meal: a dish of <b>Geesman</b> and a cup of tea, not common leaves, <i>commonplace steeps of hours</i>.</p>
<p>For legend tells how the soup is conceived of <i>holy water</i>, and the tea, ah, it steeps in sanctity — <i>it steeps for seven-thousand seven-hundred and forty-nine hours in Nebo's favor</i>.</p>
<p>By the time the meal was finished, nothing remained of the burger crumb of the sacred offering.</p>
<p>Yet the godly rose and sized, <i>their robes a rustling like unto the whispering of angels</i>, and they moved as one to the Great Church, there to chant the Doctrine, <i>eternal and ever-burning…</i></p>
